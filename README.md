# CSE6242 project: Visualizing Singaporeâ€™s Public Bus Network

In this project, we integrated bus data from the Land Transport Authority of Singapore's [datamall](https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en.html) to create a vizualization tool. The application allows the user to explore CO2 emissions from Singapore public buses, and compare the total emissions reduced.

The deployed application can be found here: [https://cse6242-project.onrender.com/](https://cse6242-project.onrender.com/)
